<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000136> a owl:Class .

<http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Journal> a owl:Class .

<http://uri.interlex.org/temp/uris/raw/> a owl:Class .

ilxtr:MISPredicate a owl:Class .

ilxtr:MISType a owl:Class .

ilxtr:Namespace a owl:Class .

ilxtr:Quantity a owl:Class .

sparc:AnimalSubject a owl:Class ;
    replacedBy: NCBITaxon:33208 ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Subject .

sparc:Dataset a owl:Class ;
    definition: "The atomic unit of publication of a nested collection of files and folders. Within SPARC this also implies that the dataset should follow the SPARC Data Structure (SDS). Metadata may be shared between datasets but all metadata relevant to a the scientific content of the dataset must be contained inside of it so that it is at least minimally self describing." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Folder .

sparc:DatasetContribution a owl:Class ;
    definition: "This is a class that represents the specific roles and contributions made by a person to a specific dataset." ;
    ilxtr:replaces TEMP:DatasetContributor .

sparc:File a owl:Class ;
    definition: "An atomic unit of data that can be identified or addressed. Can be though of as a stream of known length." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Path .

sparc:Flatmap a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Resource .

sparc:Folder a owl:Class ;
    definition: "Any identified collection of zero or more files or folders of arbitrary depth. This could also be called collection but I am trying to avoid using all the collection related terms as much as possible since the semantics are unclear and mostly we don't care." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Path ;
    editorNote: "This can be used with other types as needed to indicate some additional properties beyond the file system tree structure. For example I am explicitly not creating a sparc:Project class because determining the semantics of what is or is not a project with regards to arbitrary collections of datasets is simply not worth the effort. DANDI is envisioning something like a virtual dataset where parts are mixed, matched, combined, etc. and the provenance needed for that is far beyond what any top level assertion that a set of datasets came from the same \"project\" (whatever that means) could possibly entail. If we want to indicate that a folder corresponds to a bf:organization then we should just do that instead of trying to create new terms to capture ill defined concepts. The only exception to this is the dataset level because that a unit of identification and of publication that has special semantics that bridge across multiple systems." .

sparc:Group a owl:Class .

sparc:HumanSubject a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Specimen .

sparc:Measurement a owl:Class .

sparc:Participant a owl:Class ;
    editorNote: "This is probably more accurately Material Entity, but one that we have data about since it is appearing in some information artifact. Despite the fact that we are using the word participant in the identifier this class is meant to abstract over atomic specimens and collective (but opaque) populations on which participate in some process. If there were a better term that subsumed both atomic and collective beings that wasn't material entity (object + object aggregate), we could go with that. Normally this would be role in BFO and this classification would be inferred, because technically all continuants participate in a dual occurent that places them in time I this is ok, if a bit pedantic. See https://github.com/SciCrunch/sparc-curation/blob/master/docs/participants.org for details." .

sparc:Path a owl:Class ;
    definition: "Something equivalent to a file system path, the union of file and folder." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf sparc:Resource .

sparc:Performance a owl:Class ;
    definition: "A single performance of a scientific protocol. A process that is constrained by some prior information, usually a protocol artifact. Performances of the same protocol are extremely common in science, though there are some long running performances that are not repeated sequentially in time but rather run in parallel, e.g. longitudinal studies. Performances thus may be ongoing, though reporting of data about ongoing performances does require an identifiable sub-performance that has come to a close. Performances may produce any combination of data, material, or modified subjects. Critically, performances always happen at some point in time and are the key element of the data model which ensures that repeated performances of the same protocol can be distinguished by the data system. While this may seem obvious (e.g. asking someone their age every year)." ;
    rdfs:subClassOf BFO:0000015 ;
    editorNote: "This editor is aware of multiple data models that have made the mistake of using data model where age is asserted to be a property of a subject universally, not just a subject at a point in time. The concept of a performance is one way to avoid a multiplication of universals that can occur if one were to multiplying identifiers along the lines of person-1-at-time-1, person-1-at-time-2 etc. to accommodate multiple measurements of the same value on the same subject at different times." .

sparc:Person a owl:Class ;
    definition: "An agentous being of some variety, usually classified as such because they are participating in activities modeled by this ontology in some way." .

sparc:Pool a owl:Class .

sparc:Population a owl:Class ;

        [ a owl:Restriction ;
            owl:onProperty hasMember: ;
            owl:someValuesFrom sparc:Specimen ] ;
    editorNote: "More or less equivalent to object aggregate except that information about individual members is not known. Additional the relation between an individual member and some other object is not know. For example I may know exactly the 10 mice and brains from which 100 slices were taken, but I may not know exactly which brain an individual slice came from, there was an individual brain that it did come from, but in the data structure we can only say that it was one of these 10. The choice of word for the identifier is not the best, there are too many meanings in too many contexts. One additional constraint is that the members of a population must all be of the same type, even if that type is things-whose-mass-can-be-measured (which is likely a subClassOf things-with-mass), object aggregates do not carry this restriction." .
