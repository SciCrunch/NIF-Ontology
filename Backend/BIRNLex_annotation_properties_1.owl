   <!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: re: explicit NAMESPACE declarations
      
      1) It's good practice to declare the default namespace (xmlns=""), as it provides an explicit context for any element reference in this
      OWL file that isn't given an explicit namespace prefix.
      
      2) Note the default namespace (xmlns="") is NOT the same as the BASE namespace (xml:base), which is the base for forming URIs to 
      any entities defined within this OWL file and can be considered the base URL for this ontology.  They are often the same, 
      but there is no requirement they be the same.  In other words, if you were to set the default to the OWL spec 
      (e.g., xmlsns="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"), then all elements named without a prefix will be assumed to come from 
      the OWL spec and not assumed to be defined in this document. Only when the default (xmlns="") and the base (xml:base="") are 
      identical, will it be assumed elements without a prefix must defined in the body of this file.
      
      3) If you don't NEED to use a namespace in your OWL file, DO NOT create it, as its likely to just create compatibility problems
      that will vary depending on the tool you use. It MAY be OK to creat namespace declaration to anticipate those namespaces used 
      by other ontologies included via owl:imports.

     <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">These are OWL Annotation Properties created by the BIRN OTF for the purposes of better managing the curation of the BIRNLex ontology.</rdfs:comment>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en"> v1.2 (2007-03-20): Changed all Class identifiers to rdf:ID properties.  Some had previously been rdf:about properties.  Since Protege-OWL automatically sets new class identifiers to rdf:ID, I'm changing these across the files, to help make it more deterministic when parsing the RDF/XML.</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en">Processed file with XSLT to remove the explicit DataTypeProperty declarations (v1.2.2)</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en">Have 'cleansed' the file to be OWL-DL (v1.2.2).</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en">Now using a specific set of AnnotationProperties that link to specific Enumeration classes to specify annotations from a fixed list of values - e.g., ExternalSource, DefinitionSource.  This is the second iteration of this mechanism (first was put in v1.2.2).  This second version follows a patter recommended by Alan Ruttenberg which avoids using ObjectProperties as the Manchester design pattern for Value Partitions recommends, and instead sticks to AnnotationProperties only.  Note this version of OBO_annotation_properties uses the same EnumerationClasses from v1.2.2, and still includes the related ObjectProperties, so as to be able to support XSLT-based translation of the BIRNLex files that used the v1.2.2 pattern.  The next version of this file will eliminate the ObjectProperties and will rename the equivalent AnnotationProperties to remove the trailing '2' put in there to provide a unique name.</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en">v1.3.0 (2007-08-03) - Changed many things, but primarily: (1) removed rdf:datatype xsd:string specs for all AnnotationProperties, since they are now all untyped and should assume STRING as a the default; (2) added the typing of AnnotationProperties using annotationType which should aid in algorithmically processing; (3) added ReferenceURLTemplate to linked IDs to aid in algorithmically constructing URLs from IDs.  The reference URL template provides a URL template that includes a specification of how to combine it with the associated ID to build a putative URL for an external resource - putative in the sense that there is no guarantee the external curating authority will maintain this URL template; however, with these paired fields - ID and URL template template - it should be possible to update the template, when the authority changes their URL template - an updated that would then be algorithmicaly percollated to the use of that field across BIRNLex.</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en">v1.3.1 (2007-11-30) - Removed some UTF8 characters that dont translate well to other encodings (e.g., curly double quotes 0xE2809C).</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en"> (2008-03-13) - finally added Template URLs for GO ID.</core:changeNote>
     <core:changeNote xml:lang="en"> (2008-03-21) - finally added ID property and Template URLs for ChEBI and PubChem CIDs.</core:changeNote>

For example, the ReferenceURLTemplate ncbiTaxURLTemplate is linked to the ncbiTaxID AnnotationProperty, whose value can be combined algorithmically with this URL template to construct a working URL to the specific class reference.  This is a far from perfect solution to some of the limitations of imposed on the use of AnnotationProperties - in particular, the inability to explicitly link one annotation property to another (e.g., explicitly relating ncbiTaxID ncbiTaxURLTemplate as applied to a specific owl:Class).  However, this mechanism should suffice for now.  It will not only support more complete automatic processing of this critical information, but can also be algorithmically translated to whatever better mechanims may become available in future versions of OWL.</obo_annot:usageNote>

  <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:ID="ncbiTaxGenbankCommonName">
     <core:definition xml:lang="en">The "genbank common name" was introduced to provide a mechanism by which, when there is more than one common name associated with a particular node in the taxonomy, one of them could be designated to be the common name that should be used by default in the GenBank flat- files and other applications that are trying to find a common name to use for display (or other) purposes. This is not intended to confer any special status or blessing on this particular common name over any of the other common names that might be associated with the same node, and we have developed mechanisms to override this choice for a common name on a case-by-case basis if another name is more appropriate or desirable for a particular sequence entry. Each node may have at most one "genbank common name" (NCBI doc on NCBI Taxonomy, 2003).</core:definition>

  </owl:AnnotationProperty>
   <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:ID="ncbiTaxBlastName">
      <core:definition xml:lang="en">The "BLAST names" are a specially designated set of common names selected from the Taxonomy database. These were chosen to provide a pool of familiar names for large groups of organisms (such as "insects", "mammals", "fungi", and others) so that any particular species (which may not have an informative common name of its own) could inherit a meaningful collective common name from the Taxonomy database. This was originally developed for BLAST, because a list of BLAST results will typically include entries from many species identified by Latin binomials, which may not be familiar to all users. BLAST names may be nested; for example, "eukaryotes", "animals", "chordates", "mammals", and "primates" are all flagged as "blast names". 
         Blast names are now used in several other applications, for example the Tax BLAST displays, the Summary view in Entrez Taxonomy, and in the Summary display of the Common Tree
         format (NCBI doc on NCBI Taxonomy, 2003).</core:definition>

      <core:definition xml:lang="en">The "in-part" nametype is included for retrieval terms that have a broader range of application than the taxon or taxa at which they appear. For example, we list reptiles and Reptilia as in-part nametypes at our nodes Testudines (the turtles), Lepidosauria (the lizards and snakes), and Crocodylidae (the crocodilians).

      <core:definition xml:lang="en">The "includes" nametype is the opposite of the in-part nametype and is included for retrieval terms that have a narrower scope of application than the taxon at which they appear. For example, we could list "reptiles" as an "includes" nametype for the Amniota (or at any higher node in the lineage) (NCBI doc on NCBI Taxonomy, 2003).</core:definition>
