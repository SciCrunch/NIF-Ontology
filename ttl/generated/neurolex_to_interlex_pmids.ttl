The soma measures from 12 to 17 micrometers in its widest axis and is nearly spherical, having a rather smooth profile. The soma issues two or three short primary dendrites, which usually run horizontally. After a short distance (10 to 40 micrometers), these proximal branches give rise to sets of two to five long, secondary dendrites. The occurrence of third to order dendrites is variable, as is their length (20 to 150 micrometers). A defining characteristic of BN dendrites is the presence of distinct varicosities that are virtually devoid of dendritic spines.  The BN axon and its collaterals also exhibit a series of small spherules (0.3-0.5 um) united by thin axonal bridges (Lariva-Sahd, 2006, as reported in  http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms)." ;

The restriction of the piriform cell somata to the boundary between the zone of horizontal cells and the zone of vertical cells is remarkably accurate and consistent. The piriform cells give rise to 2 to 5 dendrites from the superficial surface, which course through the zone of horizontal cells to terminate just beneath the surface. As the ascending dendrites approach the surface they branch more frequently, almost always by equipartition, to form a complicated intermingling bouquet of slowly tapering dendrites, 150 to 350 micrometers in width and slightly less than 200 micrometers in depth. The axon most frequently takes its origin from the base of the soma, but sometimes it arises from one of the low order dendrites. From its origin the axon runs immediately down through the zone of vertical cells, occasionally with collaterals which may arborize within the superficial laminae.

Two visual areas ('LOC' and 'LOP') are included within this V4d topologue based on retinotopic fMRI data.

However, the V4d topologue did respond selectively to kinetic motion boundaries, consistent with previous human fMRI reports.

    owl:annotatedTarget "The subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of two sources of adult-born neurons in the mammalian brain, the other being the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In most adult mammals, the SVZ is a three-layered sheath that lies along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and consists of type A, B, and C cells. Type A rest along the ventricle wall and are neuronal precursor cells, Type B are adjacent astrocytes, and Type C are immature precursors to the Type A neuroblasts. The neuronal precursor cells travel along the rostral migratory stream ensheathed in a tube of Type B astrocytes, until they reach the olfactory bulb. There they integrate into the existing cellular network and mature into local interneurons. While the majority become adult-born granule cells, a subset become periglomerular cells.Interestingly, the human SVZ differs from other mammals' in several ways. It consists of four layers rather than three: ependymal cells (layer I), a hypo cellular gap (layer II), a ribbon of astrocytes (layer III), and a transitional zone (layer IV). The astrocytes are capable of differentiating into many kinds of tissue including new neurons. However, there is no evidence that the proliferating neurons travel along the rostral migratory stream in a chain to populate the olfactory bulb with new interneurons, as is the case for other mammals." ;

Over 50,000 annotations to hereditary diseases are available for download or can be browsed using the PhenExplorer.The HPO is now being developed in collaboration with members of the OBO Foundry (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies), and logical definitions for HPO terms are being developed using PATO and a number of other ontologies including the FMA, GO, ChEBI, and MPATH. The HPO can be used for clinical diagnostics in human genetics (Phenomizer), bioinformatics research on the relationships between human phenotypic abnormalities and cellular and biochemical networks, for mapping between human and model organism phenotypes, and for providing a standardized vocabulary for clinical databases, among many other things. There exists a webpage for every HPO-term.The HPO project encourages input from the medical and genetics community with regards to the ontology itself and to clinical annotations." ;

The method employs a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, whilst leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates.
