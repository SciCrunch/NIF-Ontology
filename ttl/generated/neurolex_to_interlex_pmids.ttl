The soma issues two or three short primary dendrites, which usually run horizontally. After a short distance (10 to 40 micrometers), these proximal branches give rise to sets of two to five long, secondary dendrites. The occurrence of third to order dendrites is variable, as is their length (20 to 150 micrometers). A defining characteristic of BN dendrites is the presence of distinct varicosities that are virtually devoid of dendritic spines.  The BN axon and its collaterals also exhibit a series of small spherules (0.3-0.5 um) united by thin axonal bridges (Lariva-Sahd, 2006, as reported in  http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms)." ;

This receptor is expressed in phylogenetically older regions of the brain, especially enriched in the Islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercles, and the nucleus accumbens. This suggests that this receptor plays a role in cognitive and emotional functions. It is a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia, drug addiction, and Parkinson's disease. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants that would encode different isoforms, although some variants may be subject to nonsense-mediated decay.

Some β3 agonists have demonstrated antistress effects in animal studies, suggesting it also has a role in the CNS. Beta3-Receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brain adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought to play a role in lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown fat.

Two visual areas ('LOC' and 'LOP') are included within this V4d topologue based on retinotopic fMRI data.

However, the V4d topologue did respond selectively to kinetic motion boundaries, consistent with previous human fMRI reports.

    owl:annotatedTarget "The subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of two sources of adult-born neurons in the mammalian brain, the other being the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In most adult mammals, the SVZ is a three-layered sheath that lies along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and consists of type A, B, and C cells. Type A rest along the ventricle wall and are neuronal precursor cells, Type B are adjacent astrocytes, and Type C are immature precursors to the Type A neuroblasts. The neuronal precursor cells travel along the rostral migratory stream ensheathed in a tube of Type B astrocytes, until they reach the olfactory bulb. There they integrate into the existing cellular network and mature into local interneurons. While the majority become adult-born granule cells, a subset become periglomerular cells.Interestingly, the human SVZ differs from other mammals' in several ways. It consists of four layers rather than three: ependymal cells (layer I), a hypo cellular gap (layer II), a ribbon of astrocytes (layer III), and a transitional zone (layer IV). The astrocytes are capable of differentiating into many kinds of tissue including new neurons. However, there is no evidence that the proliferating neurons travel along the rostral migratory stream in a chain to populate the olfactory bulb with new interneurons, as is the case for other mammals." ;

Over 50,000 annotations to hereditary diseases are available for download or can be browsed using the PhenExplorer.The HPO is now being developed in collaboration with members of the OBO Foundry (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies), and logical definitions for HPO terms are being developed using PATO and a number of other ontologies including the FMA, GO, ChEBI, and MPATH. The HPO can be used for clinical diagnostics in human genetics (Phenomizer), bioinformatics research on the relationships between human phenotypic abnormalities and cellular and biochemical networks, for mapping between human and model organism phenotypes, and for providing a standardized vocabulary for clinical databases, among many other things.

    owl:annotatedTarget "These flies exhibit a mutation in the protein parkin.  Loss of function in parkin results in the accumulation of toxic substrates. This causes locomotive defects, dopaminergic neuron degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and sensitivity to oxidative stress.  Physically, Parkin mutants are smaller, show locomotive dysfunction, sterile, and have a decreased lifespan.  Parkin mutant drosophila exhibit many of the same symptoms as Parkinson's disease and are used in the laboratory to study the disease." ;

The method employs a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, whilst leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. The method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared to approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests." ;
