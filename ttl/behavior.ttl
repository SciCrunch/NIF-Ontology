    ilxtr:comment "this is the measurement device or thing, e.g. a piece of paper, or the under graduate taking notes, key is that it can be passive or active, but is usually active, is the piece of paper actually closer to the sound wave? but there is a secondary information transformation, but you do still want the first named target in the task description, for piece of paper think more checkboxes or holes punches than written responses (though of course it can mediate both)"
