It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).  It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed  as a proposal to the OBO Foundry.  This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.  The BIRNLex-Main.owl ontology imports the several domain specific ontology modues required to construct a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.  This particular module contains entities related to the behavior and cognitive capabilities and actions of organisms (BB:2007-03-05)."^^xsd:string ;

Note this version of OBO_annotation_properties uses the same EnumerationClasses from v1.2.2, and still includes the related ObjectProperties, so as to be able to support XSLT-based translation of the BIRNLex files that used the v1.2.2 pattern.

This last tool is brittle, as it probably will require continued maintenance to handle more complex OWL constructs than we know have in the file - especially highly nested constructs using class axioms; (4) added use of hasReferenceURLTemplate for linking IDs; (5) Added many more concepts to cover NIF and other BIRN requirements."@en ;

    skos:editorialNote "This seems a bit contrived but appears to be an appropriate way to classify the sub-classes of behavioral activity derived from this class.  These certainly are dispositions inhering in the entity performing the activity.  There are also many behavioral activities where it really is a non-sequetor to call them behavioral functions - e.g., 'smoking' is certainly a behavior, but it really makes little sense to represent a 'smoking function' and underlying 'smoking process.' Describing behavior as an activity to which an entity is disposed makes it possible to represent very complex behaviors for which the corresponding behavioral function(s) and underlying process(es) are not yet characterized.  Note also that one can describe the activity without proscribing the associated function and underlying process - e.g., ants and humans can both be said to be disposed toward expressing 'locomotive behavior', and, yet, the associated 'locomotor function' and underlying 'locomotor process' in each organism is very different.  Note also that behavior in general is not restricted to organic 'living' entities but can also be expressed by 'non-living' entities such as the old 'bobbing bird' toy or an automatic loom.  Specific entities may have specific dispositions for expressing certain sets of behavioral activities (BB:2007-03-05)."^^xsd:string ;
    skos:changeNote "The has_integral_part restriction can be used to define complex activities that include a specific sensory component, such as a stimulus-triggered type of activity, where the stimulus targets one or more sensory modalities This restriction is not required or defining, but it declares what other continuants can be associated with a type of behavioral activity to create more complex activities.  Right now, that is limited to sensory perception associated with a particular sensory stimulus.  It's possible this is not quite the right type of obo_ro mereological relation, but it seemed like an appropriate start.  When a sensory perception is involved in an activity, it would be hard to refer to that disposition as a proper_part, though possibly this should just fall back to the more generic obo_ro:part_of (BB)."^^xsd:string ;

It is used to ascribe properties or relations to types based on tokens (i.e., on one or a small number of observations or experiences); or to formulate laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns. Induction is used, for example, in USING SPECIFIC PROPOSITIONS such as:'this ice is cold'; 'a billiard ball moves when struck with a cue' TO INFER GENERAL PROPOSITIONS such as:'all ice is cold'; 'all billiard balls struck with a cue move.' In other words, inductive reasoning infers probable antecedents as a result of observing multiple consequents - i.e., inferring some 'b' from multiple instantiations of 'a' when 'b' entails 'a'..

Abduction starts from a set of accepted facts and infers to their most likely, or best, explanations. The term abduction is also sometimes used to just mean the generation of hypotheses to explain observations or conclusions. Abductive reasoning allows inferring 'a' as an explanation of 'b'. Because of this, abduction allows the precondition 'a' of 'a entails b' to be inferred from the consequence, and, as such, such abduction is formally equivalent to the logical fallacy 'affirming the consequent.'

Equilibrioception refers to a combination of processes by which an organism can perceive its orientation with respect to gravity. In animals, stimuli come from labyrinth system of the inner ears, monitoring the direction of motion; visual stimuli, with information on orientation and motion; pressure receptors, which tell the organism which body surfaces are in contact with the ground; and proprioceptive cues, which report which parts of the body are in motion.
