* default 'users' (namespaces) for basic interlex functionality
** latest
   uncurated from whichever user made the latest change
** origin
   latest from the original defining source (user?)
*** TODO import chains
    In addition to rdfs:isDefinedBy we need to have inImportChainOf for anything
    that appears as an object in rdfs:isDefinedBy and preferably targets of
    rdfs:isDefinedBy which use version iris in addition to canonical iris
    should probably follow scigraph here (tagging every triple) and it looks
    like they get around this by simply adding the ontology that was actually
    loaded with isDefinedBy as well which would probably work

    #+NAME: table:tidb

**** Thoughts
     'isDefinedBy' lists all files that contain a specific triple
     an import closure does not add each importing ontology to isDefinedBy 
     imagine a case where we import an ontology that imports an old version of IAO
     if we have imported a newer version then the full set of triples in interlex
     will probably not reason, since the meaning of an iri may have changed
     (sigh OR strikes again) so we would need some way to tag when a triple was
     added or removed from the graph (or rather which import chains it is known to
     participate in)
*** TODO user/ontology
    this suggests that we should have a user per ontology that we load
    since not every ontology will pull in the 'latest' version of imports
    which will lead to conflicts
** default
   latest from the approved set of terms
** curated
   latest from the curated set of terms
** reasonable
   a subset of the database that is known to be reasonable
** base
   This 'user' is retained in order to provide a canonical prefix for =ilx_1234567=
   fragments that does not have any information attached to it.
   This form is used only as a reference and should have no predicates attached to it
   besides those used to map to other namespaces. It will not have its own user view
   but will redirect to one of the other builtin namespaces, probably =curated=.
* URI resolver structure =uri.interlex.org=
** Mapping between the canonical =http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_1234567= identifiers and =/uris/=
   As outlined below, =/uris/= is free form except that InterLex enforces a 1:1 mapping
   when serializing an ontology.

   The simplest and probably most sensible thing to do is to not allow any remapping of
   =/uris/= identifiers once they have been made public.

   In order for no remapping to be viable in development workflows InterLex needs to 
   to allow users/orgs to mark parts of =/uris/= as 'beta' so that they 404 for anyone
   who is not properly authorized. This can help prevent uris with potentially unstable
   mappings from leaking into use while still allowing for beta testing.
*** old thinking about alternative solutions                       :noexport:
    By default InterLex provides only the latest mapping to a given ilx identifier in a
    users =/uris/= namespace when serializing but will continue to resolve old =/uris/=
    identifiers that map to the same ilx identifier. We may need a way to allow users to
    change these mappings given some criteria, such as that there have not been any requests
    for the old uri and/or no one other than the user has serialized an ontology file with that uri.
  
    One exception to this is if a =/uris/= identifier is used in a source ontology when
    creating a new ilx identifier. In this case no remapping will be allowed, though the
    =/uris/= form can be replaced with another one, InterLex will always resolve the original
    identifier to the same ilx identifier.
   
** builtin namespaces uri structure
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/base/=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_{1234567}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/base/readable/{word}= :terminal:
    Entities listed here need to be in a 1:1 mapping from ilx_ to readable.
    These will resolve to the corresponding numeric ilx identifier page.
    We enforce 1:1 here to avoid confusion and needless multiplcation.
    Only curators may add readables to the global readable space.
    An alternate way to enable readability is to use qnames to a complete iri.
    For example in turtle =@prefix myPrefix: <http://uri.interlex.org/base/ilx_1234567> .=.
    IF we make this 1:many then we will require the selection of a preferred readable
    and the exact way to serialize will have a couple of choices as a result.
    See [[* serialization choices][serialization choices]] for more.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/base/lexical/{label}= :terminal:
    This endpoint represents a mapping of all labels to escaped uri fragments.
    If there are duplicate labels then the page resolves to a wikipedia like disambiguation page.
    This is the foundation for redlinks, which are in a sense the 'ambiguation' page for a term.

    It is not clear whether we should support lexical resolution inside of a user's =/uris/=.
    The thing that would seem to make the most sense is for there to be a way for users to
    choose which ambiguous term they personally want to resolve to. Since there is only a single
    possible set of purely lexical terms, this means that =/uris/= will NOT have a lexical subheading.
    Instead the user can define _on the global ambiguous terms_ which term they want to resolve to.

    There is a potential issue, which is that when there is a _single_ ambiguous term then it will
    resolve to the users definition of that term as with readable. The difference is that with lexical
    all of the labels by definition are conflated, so we have to include the mapping to an individual term.
    Unlike in the =/readable/= namespace, InterLex SHALL NOT define default mappings for ambiguous labels.
**** Logic
     | result count | action              |
     |            0 | ambiguate term      |
     |            1 | resolve directly    |
     |          > 1 | disambiguation page |
**** When the user is wrong
     The reason for taking the approach outlined above is that when a user enters a label for a term
     if they concept they are thinking of is not defined, but there is another concept with the same
     label masquerading as such, then we need a way to warn the user. For labels that appear on only
     a single term, a purely lexical reference will not be allowed. In fact, lexical references will
     only be allowed as redlinks and should be hastily mapped to an existing ilx_id or to a new term.
** user uri structure
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/{epoch}=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/{version-string}=
    View the version of a particular term, accessible via all the usual paths.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/{epoch}/ilx_{1234567}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/{epoch}/readable/{word}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/versions/{epoch}/uris/readable/{word}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/= :terminal:
    This subbranch represents the common reference names for ontology files
    that are actually generated by InterLex in the same way that =/readable= and =/ilx_= do.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/{hash_of_bound_name}= :terminal:
    ={consecutive integers}= is another possibility here, but the hash seems like
    it would ultimately be much cheaper, the alternative of course being that
    we could try to just stick the bound name in there directly ...
    Also a possibility =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/{qualifier}=
    but conflates and confuses matters
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/ilx_{1234567}=      :terminal:
    Used for providing a bound name when a single term is serialized.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/ilx_{1234567}/version/{epoch}/ilx_{1234567}= :terminal:
    Version iri for single term ontologies.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/{path/}filename{.ext}= :terminal:
    Need to consider naming, but this is where automatically generated ontology files could live.
    =files= or =graphs= are reasonable alternative names?
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/{path/}filename/version/{epoch}/filename{.ext}= :terminal:
    Access to versions of auto-generated ontology files.
    This may be hard to pull off for arbitrary dates.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ontologies/{path/}filename/version/{version-string}/filename{.ext}= :terminal:
    This is easier to pull off for things like uberon.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/ixl_{1234567}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/readable/{word}= :terminal:
    Entities listed here need to be in a 1:1 mapping from ilx_ to readable.
    They map to the user's view of the underlying ilx identifier.
    These are not resolved dynamically, they must be explicitly defined.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/=
    Curies are local identifiers. They identify the abbreviation that a user wishes to use for a longer identifier.
    Because abbreviations are so short, they inevitably collide. While in an ideal world users would all conform to
    community norms, the curie spec does not require that. Therefore the =/curies/= branch is provided to make it
    possible for user local curies to have globally unique identifiers.
    
    This branch is an endpoint when accessed as =/curies= or =/curies/= which when given no further arguments should return
    the full curie mapping for the user, possibly with additional information about the source of the mapping, i.e. whether
    it is the default or whether it is their own definition.
    
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/{prefix}=
    Return the iri prefix for a given curie prefix. e.g. =/curies/ilxtr= -> =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/uris/readable/= \\
    Does not resolve (adding a =:= will trigger the resolver).
    NOTE: curies are case sensitive so this endpoint MUST 404 if there is not an exact match.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/{iri}=
    Convert an iri into a curie.
    Can also be used to obtain prefixes (with a =:= attached).
    Potentially could return more than one curie depending on whether we decide to allow for multiple curie mappings (probably no). \\
    NOTE: iris passed in as =curies/http://uri.interlex.org/...= without url encoding them will require special handling but
    it should be possible.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/{curie}=
    If the curie matches, resolves to the mapped iri.
    We probably also want a way to returns the expanded iri maybe using content type?
    The curie =http:= and an iri can be distinguished because in the iri the =:= must
    be followed by =//= whereas in a curie it cannot (or if it can we won't support
    that part of the spec). \\
    NOTE: this endpoint is case sensitive.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/=
    =/uris/= is a containment mechanism for user/org specific resolvable ontology identifiers.
    We use this so that there is zero chance of collision between interlex defined paths and user
    paths. This also lets us immediately determine that this was a user defined path.
    Synonyms for this would be ~user defined uris~ ~user defined urls~ or ~user defined iris~.
    Despite the markings as =:terminal:= below, the structure of =/uris/= is completely unrestricted,
    though we do have best-practices suggestions for how to use them effectively.
    One key implementation detail is that path elements may be used as identifiers, but there shall be
    an =owl:sameAs= relationship between =uris/path/= and =uris/path=. =uris/path= shall resolve to =uris/path/=
    if it is a path element. In the event that a terminal is converted into branch (a common pattern if
    the url hierarchy reflects the subClassOf hierarchy, not that it should) then the node shall resolve to
    =uris/wasterminal/=. This means that interlex needs to track the non-terminal nodes under =/uris/=.
    The only other place users have some control over paths is in defining the locations of their ontologies.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/{path}/{local_alphanumeric_id}= :terminal:
    Ideally =local_alphanumeric_id= should be a number, but there are cases, for example
    with the DICOM terms, that are alphanumeric local ids so we need to support that.
    This means that we leave the decision about what is 'readable' to the discretion of
    the user.

    Examples of how to use this.
    =http://uri.interlex.org/hcp/uris/mmp/labels/{local_alphanumeric_id}=
    =http://uri.interlex.org/hcp/uris/mmp/versions/{local_alphanumeric_id}=
    Implicitly terminology.
    =http://uri.interlex.org/aibs/uris/mouse/versions/{local_alphanumeric_id}=
    Implicitly the terminology source, which also happens to be the atlas in this case.
    =http://uri.interlex.org/paxinos/uris/mouse/versions/{local_alphanumeric_id}=
    Explicitly the physical atlas.
    =http://uri.interlex.org/aibs/uris/atlases/mouse/versions/{local_alphanumeric_id}=
    A case where we are using external identifiers but need a valid root class in the
    ontology. This suggests that we should probably allow intermediate nodes to be
    used, though trickier to enforce safely when there are no numeric leaves.
    =http://uri.interlex.org/aibs/uris/mouse/labels/=
    Using the 'null' label as the root including the trailing slash has the additional
    nice effect that the URL will shorten and appear first in a ttl file.

*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/readable/{word}= :terminal:
    This path isolates user readable definitions from the default readable definitions.
    This prevents strangeness when switching between users.
    For example =user1/readable/brain= and =user2/readable/brain= and =default/readable/brain=
    should all point to =ILX:1234567=. However =user1/uris/readable/brain= and =user2/uris/readable/brain=
    could point to other interlex identifiers entirely.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/ontologies/{path/}filename{.ext}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/ontologies/{path/}filename/version/{epoch}/filename{.ext}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/uris/ontologies/{path/}filename/version/{version-string}/filename{.ext}= :terminal:
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/{other-user}/uris/=
    =/own/= is provided so that users can have access to their view of other
    users identifiers. This cannot be provided by mirroring =/uris/= across all
    users because =/uris/= must be isolated on a per user basis to prevent naming conflicts.
    For example =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/uris/0= and =http://uri.interlex.org/nifstd/uris/0=
    must be different by default so that both users can lift their locally unique
    integer identifiers into a globally unique space without conflicts.
    
    Practically this is important so that it is possible to enable the following
    =http://uri.interlex.org/default/ilx_1234567= has defining user
    =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/ilx_1234567= which is mapped to
    =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/uris/terms/0= which is
    given the curie =MSTL:0=. There are many cases where =MSTL:0= is 
    a recognized identifier in a community and users would like to be able
    to easily and transparently see their own view of those terms without
    having to manually map =http://uri.interlex.org/default/ilx_1234567=
    to =http://uri.interlex.org/otheruser/uris/tgbugs/terms/0= and create their
    own curie for =MSTL=. In this case I am imagining that =otheruser/uris/terms/0=
    is already taken, as in many cases it will be. Consider for example the fact
    that obo ontologies almost all have CURIE:0000000 which would have a pattern in
    InterLex akin to =uberon/uris/0000000= =go/uris/0000000=. If GO wanted to have
    a GO specific definitions for an Uberon terms to facilitate understanding by
    non-anatomists trying to use them, they would inevitably run into a case where
    there was an identifier conflict.
    
    =/own/= makes this whole process completely transparent. Any user can reference
    any other user's locally unique names and see their own version of the term.
    
    One potential wrinkle we could introduce into how we resolve =/own/= is to keep track
    of ={other-user}= and make it possible to easily load up a diff.
    
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/{other-user}/curies/=
    Like user =/uris/= curies are local identifiers. Therefore it is useful for a user
    to be able to see their own view of terms using the names (curies) defined by another user. \\
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/{other-user}/curies/{curie}=
    This endpoint returns ={user}= version of the term resolved to by
    the curie defined by ={other-user}=. This is useful functionality even if a user
    has defined curies that map to many other user's views. So for example
    =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/own/{other-user}/curies/ILX:1234567= and
    =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/own/{other-user}/curies/defaultILX:1234567= would
    both resolve to =http://uri.interlex.org/tgbugs/ilx_1234567= as indented.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/{other-user}/curies/{iri}=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/own/{other-user}/curies/{prefix}=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/diff/=
    Like =/own/= but instead of resolving to a single version of a term
    resolves to a diff of the two terms.
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/diff/{other-user}/uris/=
*** =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/diff/{other-user}/curies/=

* CURIE resolver structure =resolver.interlex.org=
  *NOTE: This section is still highly provisional.*
  Since =uri.interlex.org= is intended to manage resolvable ontology identifiers
  InterLex needs another endpoint to make it easy to resolve community defined curies.
  In order to prevent conflation of InterLex users and organizations with curies (which
  often have the same name with some case variants) this will be provided through a different
  subdomain: =resolver.interlex.org=.

  An alternate, and probably clearer name for this endpoint would be =curies.interlex.org= or
  since =resolver.interlex.org= is fairly ambiguous with regard to what it is actually resolving.
  This would also match the naming for =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/=.
** Resolving to alternate CURIE mappings
   Users who are technical enough to want the ability to resolve their own curies
   should instead select the =/{user}/ilx_{1234567}=, or =/{user}/own/= versions
   of the identifier for serialization and map the prefix to the curie they wish
   to formally resolve. If users just want to resolve a curie as a local identifier
   defined by a particular user the =http://uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/{curie}=
   endpoint provides that functionality.

   *NOTE:* =resolver.interlex.org= and =uri.interlex.org/{user}/curies/{curie}= urls are not
   appropriate for use as ontology identifiers and are disallowed as iri prefixes to prevent
   confusion. The reason for this is that curie resolvers impose semantics a local identifiers
   which can be ambiguous, and in the case of user curies, can change without warning.
** resolver uri structure
*** =http://resolver.interlex.org/{curie}=
    This is the only endpoint and it shall only resolve community approved curies using InterLex default curie mappings.
